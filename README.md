# Runtime Terror
An infinite runner inside a VS Code editor. You play as the Cursor trying to execute code while avoiding Bugs and Stack Overflow errors. The main mechanic is 'Ctrl+Z', which lets you rewind time using a Circular Buffer data structure. It's funny, relatable to every student, and technically complex enough to get us a 4.0 GPA.

## How to run
If you want to play the game, just run the *"Runtime Terror.exe"
If you want to modify the code, or work on the game:
- Download and install Raylib from https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib
- Run the "main.cpp" file from src folder
